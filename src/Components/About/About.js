          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I am a Massachusetts native that relocated to Colorado in 2009 to
            start my college journey. After completing my degree in Natural
            Resource Tourism at Colorado State University, I began my journey
            with the Vail Ski Patrol.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my time on Patrol, I learned the importance of working as a
            cohesive unit, adapting to sudden changes and
            unexpected events. I have adapted this skill into all aspects of my
            life, including web development.
          </p>
          <p>
            I tend to succeed through sheer grit and determination to be the
            best that I can. I made the decision to finally fulfill a dream of
            becoming a software developer and prove to myself and others that I
            can accomplish anything I put my mind to. After 7 months in a
            full-stack software engineering program, I now have the skills and
            knowledge to succeed as a developer. This program built a foundation
            in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and SQL.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you have a passion for the outdoors, helping others, or exploring
            unchartered territory, I would love to work with you.
          </p>
