          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I am a Massachusettes native that transplanted to Colorado in 2009
            to start my college career. After completing my degree in Natural
            Resoruce Tourism at Colorado State University, I began my journey
            with the Vail Ski Patrol.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my time on Patrol, I learned the importance of working as a
            cohesive unit at all times, and adapting to sudden changes and
            plans. I have adapted this skill into all aspects of my life, and
            web development is no different.
          </p>
          <p>
            I tend to suceed through sheer grit and determination to be the best
            that I can. If you have a passion for the outdoors, helping others,
            or exploring unchartered territory, I would love to work with you.
